            <h3>What's inside</h3>
            <p>The report provides a guide to ecosystem that has evolved in the location-based services (LBS) market and trends that point to new business opportunities in this area. The tendency among new entrants is to differentiate their service offering. However, they fail to develop their strategies with respect to the ecosystem thus rendering their business model unviable. It is not only the business model that presents a challenge. There are other LBS related challenges which include convergence, privacy concerns, reliability of location, and awareness. All these factors bring in a new set of challenges that are continuously evolving the LBS ecosystem. </p>
